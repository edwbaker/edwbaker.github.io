# Urban Nature Project

The Urban Nature Project is a major initiative at the Natural History Museum, London, aimed at transforming the Museum's gardens into an [Urban Research Station](/urban-research-station): a living laboratory for urban biodiversity research. The project focuses on understanding and enhancing urban ecosystems through innovative research, community engagement, and the use of technology.
