# Sensor Networks

My work on sensor networks began with an [open source data logger](https://doi.org/10.3897/BDJ.2.e1059) that was deployed in the grounds of the Natural History Museum, London.

Some thoughts on sensor networks:

- [Out of intense complexitiesâ€¦ individuals and indices](https://medium.ebaker.me.uk/out-of-intense-complexities-individuals-and-indices-46df4e962c9b) - balancing scope, scale and speed as the fundamental limits of what a network is capable of.

- [Abstracting heterogeneity in sensor networks](https://medium.ebaker.me.uk/sensor-networks-1-abstracting-heterogeneity-319c0c41c9fa) - how the solution to the challenges of fast-tech is slow-tech. Not trendy. Not exciting. Functional. Stable.

## Technologies

- [Raspberry Pi](/raspberrypi) - tools for Raspberry Pi sensors.

- [Arduino for biologists and environmental scientists](https://arduino.wildlife.systems) - eBook in prep.
