# More-than-human

>After stumbling around for a while in the tangled thickets of English, I finally concocted a new phrase—the more-than-human world—by which to articulate the broad commonwealth of earthly life as a realm that manifestly includes human culture, with all our creativity, our arts, and our technology, but which also (necessarily) exceeds human culture. The phrase was intended, first and foremost, to indicate that the realm of humankind (with our culture and technology) is a subset within a larger set—that the human world is necessarily embedded within, permeated by, and indeed dependent upon the more-than-human world that exceeds it.
