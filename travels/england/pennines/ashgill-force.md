↑ [The Pennines](/travels/england/pennines)

## Geology

Ashgill Force falls where the South Tyne River breaks through the Scar Limestone. The limestone rests on softer shales that are more easily eroded and creates the undercut behind the waterfall (the undercut is similar to that at [Gilbert's Cave](/travels/england/pennines/bowlees)).

## Etymology

Force is an evolution of the Old Norse _foss_ for waterfall.

## Ashgill Force Level

Part of the Ashgill Fields Mine, a lead mine operated from 1818 to 1882.
