# Welcome

I am the Acoustic Biology Researcher at the [Natural History Museum, London](https://www.nhm.ac.uk), working on the [Urban Nature Project](/urban-nature-project). I formerly worked in the Department of Electronic Engineering at the [University of York](https://york.ac.uk) (Leverhulme funded [Automated Acoustic Observatories](aao) project) and the [International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature](http://iczn.org).

[ðŸ¦—.fm](https://ðŸ¦—.fm/) - my work on museum sound collections and the bioacoustics of Orthoptera.
