# Welcome

I am currently an Acoustic Biology Researcher at Natural History Museum, London, working on the [Urban Nature Project](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/about-us/urban-nature-project.html). I formerly worked in the Department of Electronic Engineering at the [University of York](https://york.ac.uk) (Leverhulme funded [Automated Acoustic Observatories](aao) project) and the [International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature](http://iczn.org).

[ðŸ¦—.fm](https://ðŸ¦—.fm/) - my work on museum sound collections and the bioacoustics of Orthoptera.
