Successfully finding the Scabious Longhorn Moth (_Nemophora metallica_) in the NHM Gardens (with David Lees and Maja Petric).

> "In Middlesex the moth seems very scarce. There are no historical records and the earliest report is from 2012 at Heathrow (Causeway nature reserve - an unvalidated record submitted to iRecord). This was followed by one at the Natural History Museum’s wildlife garden in South Kensington in 2017 – and again in 2020. The origin of these moths is perhaps questionable as the moths may have been imported on plants from other sites."
