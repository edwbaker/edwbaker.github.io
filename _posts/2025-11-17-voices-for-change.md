On Monday 17 November 2025, the Natural History Museum hosted [Voices for Change: A Night of Climate Action](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/events/voices-for-change-a-night-of-climate-action.html), a free evening event exploring climate challenges and solutions during COP30.

I participated in the Natural Heroes Pop-Up Station, where I had the opportunity to discuss the Museum's new gardens with Neil Davidson from landscape architects [J&L Gibbons](https://www.jlgibbons.com/). 

Our conversation focused on the nature-positive and climate-friendly features integrated into the garden design. We explored how these innovative elements serve as practical examples that can inspire and inform other landscape projects, demonstrating how urban green spaces can actively contribute to biodiversity conservation and climate resilience.

The evening brought together scientists, activists, and community members for discussions, performances, and hands-on activities, all aimed at driving collective action for the planet. It was inspiring to see so many people engaged with the challenges of the climate crisis and eager to explore practical solutions.

The event ran alongside COP30 in Belém, Brazil, creating a connection between global climate policy discussions and local action that individuals and communities can take.
