__About the session__

Sounds produced by animals are increasingly being used to help us understand the natural world. In this session, we'll take an overview of the reasons for sound production, the concept of a soundscape, and the impacts of noise.

In order to effectively study sounds we need to make sound recordings, so we will follow the overview with a discussion on the principles of sound recording, and if weather allows make some sound recordings of our own. This will be followed by a session on the basic principles of sound analysis, and how it can be applied to studies of the natural world.
