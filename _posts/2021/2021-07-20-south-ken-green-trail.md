​

From 23 July, three pop-up green installations will start to be built on Exhibition Road. The architectural installations will be in place outside the Natural History Museum, Science Museum and Imperial College (opposite Goethe-Institut) and will be in place until mid-October, and will connect with planting and green spaces across the district as part of the South Ken Green Trail.

​The project aims to create a welcoming focus for visitors returning to Exhibition Road and to inspire engag​ement and debate around urban biodiversity and environmental challenges in the run-up to COP26. Harnessing South Kensington's arts and science connections, the trail draws on research and expertise from the area's institutions to explore ideas and innovations from soil health, to regenerative architecture and planting for wild pollinators. It will also promote the RBKC 'Bee SuperHighway' and Exhibition Road partners' actions to support local wildlife and biodiversity. 

Commissioned by Discover South Kensington in partnership with the London Festival of Architecture, the trail is being supported by the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851, RBKC, Westminster Council and the GLA.
