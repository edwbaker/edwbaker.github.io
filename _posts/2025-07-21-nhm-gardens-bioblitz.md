BioBlitz Celebrates One Year of the Museum’s Gardens

Monday 28 July, 11:00 – 16:00

Free. No booking required.

Nature enthusiasts of all ages are invited to celebrate the first anniversary of the Natural History Museum’s transformed gardens with a free, family-friendly BioBlitz, a vibrant day of nature discovery, perfect for families, nature enthusiasts, and budding young explorers alike. Every observation made will contribute to real scientific research, offering a rare chance to explore the city’s natural world through the eyes of scientists.

A BioBlitz is an exciting, hands-on event where scientists and the visitors of all ages team up to record as many different species as possible in a set time. A fast-paced wildlife survey, part science, part scavenger hunt, all set within the stunning backdrop of the Museum’s Nature Discovery Garden.

A great way to keep kids entertained during the summer holidays, activities running throughout the day will include:

    - Pond dipping offers children and adults the chance to explore the fascinating underwater world, discovering creatures like toads and newts
    - Field surveys will help identify and log the plants and animals living in the gardens, including birds and insects
    - Surveying the wildlife garden's smallest animals with DNA barcodes
