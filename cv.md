# Ed Baker - Curriculum Vitae

My research includes all aspects of bioacoustics from field recording, through analysis and machine learning methods, to long term preservation, with a focus on the bioacoustics of insects. This work has included digitizing the collection of the Natural History Museum and making these available for access and analysis through the [BioAcoustica](https://bio.acousti.ca) platform for which I led initial development. I also develop acoustic monitoring systems that are integrated with analysis and species identification systems, including as part of the [Automated Acoustic Observatories](/aao) project at the University of York and the Urban Nature Project at the Natural History Museum.  I have a background in the orthopteran insect orders, museum collections (including extended specimen concepts), and biodiversity informatics.

## Work

__Acoustic Biology Researcher (2022-)__  
_Natural History Museum, London_

Leading the development and deployment of an urban acoustic network in the Museum’s grounds and at partner sites nationwide and developing machine learning models for the identification and monitoring of biodiversity (in particular, making use of the Museum’s collection of recorded insect sounds). Science lead on the Nature Overheard citizen science project that was co-designed with school children and investigates the impacts of road noise on biodiversity. Developing sound libraries to enable the acoustic monitoring of new insect groups, including pollinators.
