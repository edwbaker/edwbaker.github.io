# Ed Baker - Curriculum Vitae

My research includes all aspects of bioacoustics from field recording, through analysis and machine learning methods, to long term preservation, with a focus on the bioacoustics of insects. This work has included digitizing the collection of the Natural History Museum and making these available for access and analysis through the [BioAcoustica](https://bio.acousti.ca) platform for which I led initial development. I also develop acoustic monitoring systems that are integrated with analysis and species identification systems, including as part of the [Automated Acoustic Observatories](/aao) project at the University of York and the Urban Nature Project at the Natural History Museum. I have a background in the orthopteran insect orders, museum collections (including extended specimen concepts), and biodiversity informatics.

## Work

__Acoustic Biology Researcher (2022-)__  
_Natural History Museum, London_

Leading the development and deployment of an urban acoustic network in the Museum’s grounds and at partner sites nationwide and developing machine learning models for the identification and monitoring of biodiversity (in particular, making use of the [Museum’s collection of recorded insect sounds](https://bio.acousti.ca)). Science lead on the [Nature Overheard](/nature-overheard) citizen science project that was co-designed with school children and investigates the impacts of road noise on biodiversity. Developing sound libraries to enable the acoustic monitoring of new insect groups, including pollinators.

__Research Associate: Anti-Locust Research Centre Digitisation – Feasibility Study (2021)__  
_Stockholm Environment Institute & Department of History, University of York_

Archive analysis and documentation project to assess the potential for digitising the ALRC collection. This led to the development of an EU Horizon 2020 proposal (in review) with contextual digitisation of the archive forming part of micro-scale crop threat forecasting (sorghum and avocado) in Kenya and neighbouring countries (AGRIFEAST).

__Acoustic Monitoring Officer (2020-2021)__  
_Natural History Museum, London_

Development and deployment of a prototype acoustic and abiotic sensor network across multiple sound transmission media (air, freshwater, living and dead timber, soil) as part of the initial phase of the Urban Nature Project. Production of recommendation report for the next phase of the project on network expansion and how to correlate acoustic monitoring with other surveying techniques, including traditional site surveys and environmental DNA analyses.

__Research Associate: Automated Acoustic Observatories (2017-2020)__  
_Department of Electronic Engineering, University of York_

Leverhulme Trust funded project that I helped develop to produce electronic devices for acoustic monitoring of grasshoppers and crickets (Orthoptera) incorporating ultrasound recording and automated species identification. My work involved creating the most comprehensive database of species-specific songs in insects, developing methods for automated acoustic trait extraction, algorithms for using these traits to identify species, and design of the devices. The trait database is also being used to analyse the evolution of orthopteran song using a phylogenetic supertree created my other members of the research team.

__Nomenclatural Informatics Advisor (2009-2014)__  
_International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature_

Installing a ZooBank node at the Natural History Museum as part of the NSF funded Global Names Architecture project. Advising on, and implementing data systems for, the handling of submitted proposals through to official Opinions. Organizing public events including Attenborough on Fortey: On Animals and Anchoring Biodiversity Information: From Sherborn to the 21st Century and Beyond. Help with management of Cases submitted to the Commission.

__Biodiversity Informatician (2007-2017)__  
_Natural History Museum, London_

One of a team of software developers working on the Scratchpads virtual research environment (VRE) under the European Union funded ViBRANT project. Lead NHM developer of the NERC funded eMonocot project with the University of Oxford and the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew building a VRE for communities to contribute taxonomic information. Project lead for the In-Situ Acoustic Monitoring of Biodiversity project with David Chesmore, University of York (building acoustic identification devices combined with environmental monitors for long-term study at field sites). Project lead for digitisation and development of the NHM’s Wildlife Sound Archive (an important collection for work on Orthoptera Bioacoustics).
