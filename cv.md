# Ed Baker - Curriculum Vitae

My research includes all aspects of bioacoustics from field recording, through analysis and machine learning methods, to long term preservation, with a focus on the bioacoustics of insects. This work has included digitizing the collection of the Natural History Museum and making these available for access and analysis through the BioAcoustica platform for which I led initial development. I also develop acoustic monitoring systems that are integrated with analysis and species identification systems, including as part of the Automated Acoustic Observatories project at the University of York and the Urban Nature Project at the Natural History Museum.  I have a background in the orthopteran insect orders, museum collections (including extended specimen concepts), and biodiversity informatics.
