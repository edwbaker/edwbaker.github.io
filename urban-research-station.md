# Urban Research Station

By 2050 [68% of the world's population](https://www.un.org/uk/desa/68-world-population-projected-live-urban-areas-2050-says-un) will live in urban areas. The Urban Research Station studies how urban areas can be made better for people, for nature, and for the climate (and hopefully also create joy).

## Sensor network

The sensor network will consist of round 25 devices measuring acoustic activity and the environment.

### Studies

- [Urban heat islands](/notes/urs-urban-heat-islands-study) - studying the impact of urbanisation on temperature variations.

- Acoustics

## Visual Observations

There is a long history of visual observations of species, these are currently collected through a mix of transects and ad-hoc recording.

Anybody can contribute to ad-hoc recording using iNaturalist or iRecord.

## More-than-human approaches

More-than-human appraoches to biodiversity research are looking at how we can make urban areas more habitable for all species.
