# Bioacoustics

Background to some bioacoustics ideas and principles

- [Mosaic of the air](https://medium.ebaker.me.uk/mosaic-of-the-air-partitioning-the-acoustic-space-d51bdb69bbf7) How the acoustic space can be partitioned.

- [Out of intense complexitiesâ€¦ individuals and indices](https://medium.ebaker.me.uk/out-of-intense-complexities-individuals-and-indices-46df4e962c9b) Balancing scope, scale and speed as the fundamental limits of what a network is capable of.

- [Nature is never silent?](https://medium.ebaker.me.uk/nature-is-never-silent-b2062a4cc5d5) Is nature actually noisy?

## Bioacoustics pioneers

- [G. W. Pierce](https://medium.ebaker.me.uk/bioacoustic-pioneers-g-w-pierce-ca088d9e3b69) Physicist who made his own devices to study the songs of Orthoptera, started the misuse of the word _pulse_, and made early hydrophones.
