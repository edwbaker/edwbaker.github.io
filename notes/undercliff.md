### The Undercliff

From what I can tell this view has probaby gone forever due to the continual landslip and erosion of the Undercliff (would be very happy to be corrected). The view below (22/06/2025) is a view of the same cliffs from a similar location and angle.

### White Chapel Rock

Again, there seems to be some amount of ground movement, but this is the closest view I can find to the one in the film. There is fresh rock fall (visible to the left, and by the relaive cleanliess of the cliff face to the left), but this is the best match in the ara of White Chapel Rock.
