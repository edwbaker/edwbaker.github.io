# Axmouth to Lyme Regis Undercliff

## Locations

### Chapel Rock

The site of non-conformist worship in the 1660s, Chapel Rock is a prominent feature of the Undercliff. It is currently well off, and not visible from, the South West Coast Path. The location can be discerned from older maps, but there are currently no paths to it, and access without a guide is not recommended.

## Washing Rock

Washing Rock is a large rock in the Undercliff, and probably gets its name from being white-washed as a navigation aid when the undercliff was an open area of farmland. Natural England have recently (2025) created a new path to the rock from the South West Coast Path, and cleared some of the surrounding vegetation. This makes the rock both much more accessible, and much more visible.

## The French Lieutenant's Woman

### 'The Undercliff'

From what I can tell this view has probaby gone forever due to the continual landslip and erosion of the Undercliff (would be very happy to be corrected). The view below (22/06/2025) is a view of the same cliffs from a similar location and angle.

### White Chapel Rock

Whit Chapel Rock, as the location of 1660s non-conformist worship, is to the west of the location used in the film.

Again, there seems to be some amount of ground movement, but this is the closest view I can find to the one in the film. There is fresh rock fall (visible to the left, and by the relaive cleanliess of the cliff face to the left), but this is the best match in the ara of White Chapel Rock.
