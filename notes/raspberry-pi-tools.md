# Useful tools for maintaining Raspberry Pi sensor networks

This document lists tools and equipment that are useful for maintaining Raspberry Pi sensor networks.

## Raspberry Pi and connections

This list is based on a sensor network that uses multiple generations and formats of Raspberry Pis. If you are using a single model, you will not need all of these items.

- SD card adaptor for computer
- micro HDMI and mini HDMI to HDMI adaptor
- mini USB and USB-C power adaptors

## Power-over-Ethernet (PoE)

- PoE switch or PoE injector
- A supply of PoE hats
- PoE tester

## Ethernet

While it is possible to build a sensor network from commercially available cables, it is likely to be more conveniient (and cost effective) to make your own to custom lengths.

- A supply of Ethernet cables (or a drum of cable)
- A supply of Ethernet plugs
- Ethernet crimping tool
- Ethernet cable tester

## Soldering

- Soldering iron + stand
- Solder
- Desoldering braid
- Flux pen

## Heat-shrink

- Heat gun
- Heat shrink tubing

## Cleaning

- Isopropyl alcohol
- Alcohol wipes
- Cotton buds
- Nail brush
