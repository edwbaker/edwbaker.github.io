# Sensor network philosophy

## Don't innovate the basics

We have established solutions for many problems, these solutions come with existing experience and communities. We should not innovate for the sake of innovation.

### Commodity hardware

Bespoke hardware is expensive and difficult to maintain. Commodity Linux hardware such as Raspberry Pi is cheap, can be supported by existing IT teams, and has a large community of users. There is a clear replacement and upgrade path.

### Existing software solutions

### Automate maintenence

- [Raspberry Pi](/raspberrypi) - some software solutions that facilitate installation and maintenence of a sensor network.

## Build for the future

### Over-capacity

Installing an underground wired network is a once-only opportunity. We should install more capacity than we need now, so that we can expand the network in the future. This includes over-specifying the digital network capacity, and preparing the grounds for the installation of more sensors.

### Easy to maintain

### Expandable
