# SANE defaults

The default behaviour of functions, APIs, applications, etc is often specified or designed to be 'sane' - but does this actually mean? Use the SANE default acronym.

## Simple

The default options should give usable and useful output for the majority of use cases. Little-used functionality is for non-default behaviours.

## Aligned

Align default values both internally and externally. All functions in a package should have consistent and compatible default values. If there is consistency in prevailing usage externally, follow it.

## Neat

The default options should be neat and tidy. This applies whether the goal is a visualisation, data, a composition of functions, etc.

## Expected

Many disciplines have expected norms. If your code reflects these disciplines then use the expected norms. Follow the principle of least surprise.
